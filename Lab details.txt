The difference between a VNet (Virtual Network) and a subnet is mainly about scope and structure in a cloud network (like Azure or AWS VPC, which is conceptually similar):
ðŸ”¹ VNet (Virtual Network)
What it is: A VNet is the top-level isolated network environment in a cloud platform.
Purpose: Provides a private network space for your resources (VMs, databases, etc.).
CIDR Range: You define a large IP address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Function: Think of it like your entire virtual data center or LAN in the cloud.
ðŸ”¸ Subnet
What it is: A subdivision of the VNetâ€™s IP space.
Purpose: Helps you segment the network for organization, security, and routing (e.g., front-end vs. back-end).
CIDR Range: A smaller block within the VNet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).
Function: Like putting different departments or tiers of an app into separate rooms inside the same building.
